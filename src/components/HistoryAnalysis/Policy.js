                To meet the Council's statutory duties in allocating Council housing and making nominations to housing associations and other Councils, the Housing Allocations Scheme will:
                Meet local housing need through providing access to affordable housing based on a full assessment of individual circumstances and a fair and transparent system for deciding who gets priority
                Provide a simple system that is easy to understand and which customers recognise as fair.
                Meet our legal duties in carrying out allocations and fulfilling our statutory duties.
                Prevent homelessness where possible, encouraging planned pathways into housing and minimising the use of bed and breakfast accommodation for homeless households.
                Promote Housing Options to meet the variety of housing need
                Ensure the efficient processing of applicants to suitable and sustainable homes and to make sure that housing within the Borough is being effectively used for those in need and maximising the best use of the housing stock within the Borough
